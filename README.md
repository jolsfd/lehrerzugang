# Lehrerzugang

## Description

This project is a cloudflare pages application. It enables you to see where a teacher teaches. No more clicking through timetables of endless classes that you don't care about. This functionality is achieved by a cloudflare worker that bypasses the cors functionality from the stundenplan24 api. Credentials like passwords, logins or ids are never exposed to the public.
